jbparse: The J-Ben dictionary parsing library
Copyright 2009 by Paul Goins
Released under the two-clause OSI-approved BSD license (see COPYING.txt)

This library is intended to allow J-Ben, and other Python-based
programs, to easily use Jim Breen's Japanese dictionary data files
such as EDICT, JMdict, KANJIDIC and KANJIDIC2.

No documentation yet exists, however examining the test folder should
show how this library can be used.

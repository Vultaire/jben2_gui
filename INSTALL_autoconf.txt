J-Ben uses autoconf and automake for building the bundled "kpengine"
application.  This document is intended for those who are not familiar
with using the autotools directly.

If the bundled application does not contain a "configure" script (for
example, if pulled directly from git), the following should create the
needed files:

    autoreconf -i

Afterwards: "./configure && make" as usual.


Tested on Windows with:

- autoconf 2.67
- automake 1.11.1

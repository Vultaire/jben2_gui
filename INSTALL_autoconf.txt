J-Ben uses autoconf and automake for building the bundled "kpengine"
application.  This document is intended for those who are not familiar
with using the autotools directly.

If the bundled application does not contain a "configure" script (for
example, if pulled directly from git), the following should create the
needed files:

    autoreconf -i

Afterwards:

If running on POSIX (Linux, BSD, etc.):

  ./configure && make
  make install

If running on Windows, it's a bit more complicated:

  Do the basic build:

    CFLAGS=-mwindows ./configure && make

  Make the py2exe executable:

    cd python; setup.py py2exe

  Run the Inno Setup jben.iss file (update as necessary for your environment)

  Install the generated executable

Tested on Windows with:

- autoconf 2.67
- automake 1.11.1
- py2exe 0.6.9
- Python 2.7
- GTK bundle 2.22.0-20101016_win32
- pygtk 2.22.0
- pygobject 2.26.0
- pycairo 1.8.10

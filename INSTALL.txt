POSIX build instructions (Linux, BSD, etc.)
===========================================

J-Ben uses the standard "./configure; make; make install" process.
Just try the following:

  ./configure && make
  make install

To run the program:

  python -m jben.main

"jben_launcher.py" *may* also work, but it has not yet been tested.


Windows build instructions
==========================

Prerequisites:

1. MinGW, MSys, and the autotools.  (If you don't have these, go to
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/, and download the
   "latest version": mingw-get-inst-XXXXXXXX.exe.)

2. GTK+ development libraries.  Get the GTK+ development bundle from
   www.gtk.org.  Unzip it somewhere and insert its bin folder into
   your PATH (preferably at the beginning of the PATH to avoid
   conflicts with other libraries).

3. Inno Setup, for creating the installer.

Instructions are as follows:

1. Do the basic build:

     CFLAGS=-mwindows ./configure && make

2. Make the py2exe executable:

     cd python; setup.py py2exe

3. Run the Inno Setup jben.iss file (update as necessary for your environment)

4. Install the generated executable

This process has been tested on Windows 7 with:

- autoconf 2.67
- automake 1.11.1
- py2exe 0.6.9
- Python 2.7
- GTK bundle 2.22.0-20101016_win32
- pygtk 2.22.0
- pygobject 2.26.0
- pycairo 1.8.10
